            I rented the Lagoon 620 with my family for a week-long vacation and
            it was the best decision ever. The yacht was spacious, comfortable,

            The Azimut 80 was the most luxurious yacht I've ever been on. The
            cabins were spacious and elegant, and the outdoor areas were perfect
            for relaxing and entertaining. Worth every penny!
